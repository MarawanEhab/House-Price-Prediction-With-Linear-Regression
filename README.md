# House Price Prediction  🚀

## Dataset Story 📊
This dataset contains various features that influence house prices, such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, the age of the house, and more. The primary objective of this dataset is to understand the factors affecting house prices and to predict the price of a house based on these features. By analyzing this dataset, we can develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices, which is valuable for real estate analysis and decision-making.

## Business Problem 💼
The business problem is to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices. This prediction can help in understanding the real estate market, making informed decisions in buying or selling properties, and optimizing investment strategies. Predicting house prices accurately will enable better financial planning and resource allocation in the real estate industry. 🌟

## Project Steps 🛠️
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Analyze the distribution and relationships of features in the dataset.
Visualize the data to understand the underlying patterns and correlations.
Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data transformations to ensure data quality.

## Feature Engineering 🔧
Encode categorical features to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Scale numerical features for better model performance.
Address any imbalanced data issues to ensure robust model training.

## Model Building 🤖
Build and evaluate different machine learning models to predict house prices:
Linear Regression

## Model Evaluation 📈
Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Select the best-performing model for deployment, ensuring it provides accurate and reliable predictions.

## By following these steps, we aim to create a powerful tool for predicting house prices, ultimately driving better real estate business outcomes. 🌟💼
